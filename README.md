### Corresponding Author:

This repository contains code and data described in the paper, Quantum Algorithms for Flow in Geologic Fracture Networks.  The code was authored and the data was collected by Jessie M. Henderson and Mariana Podzorova.

### Dependencies
Use of this codebase requires at least Python 3.0 and use of the following modules:
- Argparse
- Math
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Pathlib
- Pylab
- Qiskit
- Scipy
- Seaborn

### Documentation
Our goal was to include enough documentation within the code such that it's usable without additional documentation.  Should you have any questions or seek further documentation, please contact the corresponding author.

### Brief Description of Results
1. Uniform Permeability with 6x8 Regions: This code and data is described in both Section III of the main text, and Section V.B.3 of the Methods.
2. Uniform Permeability with Larger Regions: This code and data is described in both Section III of the main text, and Section V.B.4 of the Methods.
3. Preliminary Results with Varying Permeability: This code and data is described in Section VI.C of the Supplementary Information.
